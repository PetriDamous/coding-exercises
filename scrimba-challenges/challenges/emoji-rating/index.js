DESCRIPTION:
You job is to enable users to give a rating between 1 (bad) and 5 (great), 
and then display that rating in the form of an emoji. The users should give 
their ratings by pressing a key on their keyboards (the numbers 1 to 5). 
Here's the numbers' corresponding emojis:

5 = đ
3 = đ
3 = đ
2 = âšī¸
1 = đ¤Ŧ

event listeners, keyboard events, key codes, 
focus, focusout, DOM manipulation, tabindex

*/

const box = document.getElementById("box");
const text = document.getElementById("text");
const emojiContainer = document.getElementById("emoji-container");

const rating5 = String.fromCodePoint(0x1F929);
const rating4 = String.fromCodePoint(0x1F604);
const rating3 = String.fromCodePoint(0x1F612);
const rating2 = String.fromCodePoint(0x1F611);
const rating1 = String.fromCodePoint(0x1F92C);

const ratingsArray = [rating1, rating2, rating3, rating4, rating5];

box.addEventListener("focus", function(){
    text.textContent = "Type a number between 1 and 5";
});

box.addEventListener("focusout", function(){
    text.textContent = "Click here to give your rating!";
});


// Write your code here

// /
box.addEventListener("keydown", e => {
    
    // if (!e.target.closest("#text")) return;

    ratingsArray.forEach((rating, idx) => {
        if (e.key === (idx + 1).toString()) {
            emojiContainer.textContent = rating;
        } 
    });
});


/*

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS
1. Listen for keyboard events when the box has focus
2. Figure out which key the user pressed
3. If it's between 1 and 5, display an emoji in the box!

STRETCH GOALS:
- Animate the emoji onto the screen! Why not go crazy with multiple emojis? 
- Reset the entire app when box doesn't have focus anymore
- Can you improve the overall design?
